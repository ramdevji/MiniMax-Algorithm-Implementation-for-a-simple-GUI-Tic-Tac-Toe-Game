# MiniMax-Algorithm-Implementation-for-a-simple-GUI-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Used the pygame library of python for :
1.Drawing the Board and Displaying it.
2.Getting the user events such as Mouse click and getting the position of the square the User cliked.
3.Setting back the Optimal move to the screen generated by MinMax algorithm.

Algorithm Description and Implementation:
1.MinMax is a simple decision making algorithm.At the leaves are the decisions and it is a recursive tree like algorithm.
2.It is widely used in gaming for predicting the next optimal move.
3.It's very simple and easy to understand.
4.There are two players Min and Max,Min always wants to move in such a way such that there are minimum chances for wining the game for Max 
Player and Max moves in such a way that there are Maximum chances for it or it chooses the optimal value in such a way such that Min gets 
low score among the all other values.

PseudoCode:
function minimax(board, depth, isMaximizingPlayer):

    if current board state is a terminal state :
        return value of the board
    
    if isMaximizingPlayer :
        bestVal = -INFINITY 
        for each move in board :
            value = minimax(board, depth+1, false)
            bestVal = max( bestVal, value) 
        return bestVal

    else :
        bestVal = +INFINITY 
        for each move in board :
            value = minimax(board, depth+1, true)
            bestVal = min( bestVal, value) 
        return bestVal
